Working on Git Remote repository(github)
=============================================
1 Open github.com
2 Signup for a free account
3 Signin into that account
4 Click on + icon on top right corner--->Click on New repository
5 Enter some name for the repository
6 click on Create repository
7 Go to "push an existing repository from the command line"
8 Copy the 1st command and paste in gitbash
  This command will create a link between the git localrepository
  and the github rmeote repository
9 git push -u origin master
  enter username and password of github
  This will upload the code into the remote github server
  This process is called checkin

Downloading the code from github
====================================
This can be done in 3 ways
1) git clone
2) git fetch
3) git pull

git clone is used to download the entire repository into the local machine.
It will downlaod all the files irresepective of whether those files are already present on out machine or not

Initially the team lead creates the fodler structrue and all the developers will perfrom a clone operation into their machines.All the code with the basic fodler structure is downloaded.

git fetch will work only when there are some modifications in  the data
ie the data present in the local repository is different from the data 
present on the remote repository.
git fetch will download the modified data and store it on a remote branch
We can go to the remote branch check if the code changes are accpetable 
or not it they are acceptable merge the remote branch with the master branch.

1 Open git hub.com
2 Click on any file--->Click on Edit icon and edit that file
3 Click on commit changes
4 Open gitbash
5 git fetch
  The modified data will not be visible on master,it will be present on a
  remote branch
6 git branch -a
  Identify the name of the remote branch from the above output
7 Move to that remote branch
  git checkout -b remotes/origin/master
8 View the modified files.If it is acceptable move to master and merge
  git checkout master
  git merge remotes/origin/master


git pull will also work only when there are modifications and it will download
only the modified files but it will directly merge it with master branch
1 Open git hub.com
2 Click on any file--->Click on Edit icon and edit that file
3 Click on commit changes
4 Open gitbash
5 git pull
  The modified files will be visible in master branch
